## 27.3.2022: Typescript and finding a project
Over the last two weeks I have began to learn typescript and the basics of rust. This is in preparation of working on a collaborative website designed for the badminton society at Durham. Most of the javascript for the project will be written in Typescript and the back end will be written in rust. I been learning rust through the online book [The Rust Programming Language](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/). 

So far I have been able to cover variables, variable mutability, data types, and functions along with rust ownership and structs. I have also been translating some of my existing python programs from previous projects and assignments into rust for practice. On the Typescript side I have been learning from [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/typescript/typescript_object_types.php). So far Object types, arrays, tuples and enumerated values have been covered.

My goals for this project are to successfully write front end client side fetch api in typescript and be able to modify and add functionality to a REST api written in rust. The collaborative website will be for members of the badminton society to be able to create profiles for themselves and record their games and opponents. Through this we will be able to implement an elo system creating a general approximation of how good a player is. I plan to handle most of the front end html and javascript however we may decide to switch the fetch api to also be written in rust.

## 6.4.2022: More Rust and Starting project
Over this week I have learned more Rust going back over to get a better understanding of Rust ownership concerning pointers and Rust's built in garbage collection system, most of which was learnt from the rust programming language book. This was mostly done between Monday and Wednesday. Most of the rest of the week was spent starting working on the website project. Most of this work was just creating a dashboard type html template page where users can see their profile statistics, these include: ELO, recent games and more.

The template page I build using bootstrap which helped develop my knowledge in how to use bootstrap grids and containers to lay out elements on the page. So far the information on the page such as games and user elo are just stand in text as I have not started doing the front end javascript. Much of the lack of actual functionality at the moment is also due to the current lack of a back end api.

The current next steps for me are to practice and familiarise myself more with typescript so I can start working on the clientside fetch api as soon as some of the back end rust api is implemented and functional. There have been no changes to my final goal of helping produce a functional front end web page and typescript fetch api.
